This is an Eiffel wrapping og the 'cryptlib' package; see the website:

http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/cryptlib/

also:

http://www.cryptlib.com

It [cryptlib] encompasses encryption, secure hashing, secure/MIME, certificate management etc, etc


This code was originally started using Small/Smart Eiffel, and only generation of the Eiffel class ECRYPT_CONSTANTS was completed,
implemented in the single root class ECRYPT_MAKE_CONSTANTS.

It is very much work-in-progress ... !!
